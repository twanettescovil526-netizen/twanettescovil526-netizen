## 🚀 About Me 
Future Data Analyst looking to step into the Crime/Intelligence Analyst industry. My lifelong love of reading, writing, and drawing makes me passionate about data visualization which can bring data to life!

My focus is on building projects and creating a solid portfolio. I'm gaining the techinical skills used in Data Analytics such as Excel, Python, and SQL through Year Up United whixh also gives people those extremely useful professional skills and personal branding everyone needs in a workplace. 

When I'm not working with data, I enjoy [drawing, reading, writing, anything superheros, and photography]. I love the "aha!" moment when data reveals something new and useful.
